    <h2>Transit Software</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <a href="https://github.com/jamespfennell/transiter">Transiter</a> is a web service that
                subscribes to realtime transit data feeds and provides views on the data through a REST API.
                <a href="https://demo.transiter.io/">Demo site</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="small">
                Transiter is written in Python with the help of some great libraries
                (Flask, SQL Alchemy, Celery, APScheduler).
                It uses Postgres as a database.
                I personally deploy it using Docker compose, but it also works with Kubernetes.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/jamespfennell/transiter-nycsubway">Transiter New York</a>
            contains code and configuration for integrating
            NYC-area transit systems (subway, PATH) with Transiter.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/jamespfennell/path-train-gtfs-realtime">PATH Train GTFS Realtime</a>
            is a Go application that generates a GTFS Realtime feed for the PATH train system
            in New York and New Jersey.
            <a href="https://path.transitdata.nyc/gtfsrt">Stable feed url</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                The <a href="https://www.realtimerail.nyc">realtimerail.nyc webapp</a> displays train times for the NYC
                Subway.
                Despite being branded, it's fully open source
                (<a href="https://github.com/jamespfennell/realtimerail.nyc-react">repository</a>).
            </p>

            <p class="small">
                Written in JavaScript/React and uses Transiter as a backend.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Typesetting</h2>

    <p>When I was doing research mathematics I got into typesetting and created one thing people have found useful:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/jamespfennell/mathtime-installer">Linux and Mac installer</a>
            for Michael Spivak's MathTime Professional 2 fonts for Latex.
            There's a free version of the fonts, so you have no excuse to continue using
            the overbearingly ubiquitous Computer Modern.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="small">
        If I had unlimited free time my big project would be to re-write (La)Tex from scratch.
        Despite it having a somewhat cult-like status in certain communities,
        I think it's pretty flawed both aesthetically and as a piece of software engineering.
    </p>
    <p class="small">
        (For aesthetics, read <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Elements-Typographic-Style-Robert-Bringhurst/9780881792126">
        The Elements of Typographical Style</a> and make a note every time Latex
        breaks a basic typographical rule. You will have many notes.)
    </p>

    <h2>Mathematics</h2>

    <p>
        I obtained my PhD in mathematics from the Courant Institute, New York University, in 2018.
        My adviser was <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/~pgermain">
        Pierre Germain</a>.
        My thesis is entitled
        <i>Two topics in the theory of nonlinear Schr&ouml;dinger equations</i>
        (<a href="./JamesFennell-PhDThesis.pdf">PDF download</a>).
    </p>

    <p>Doctorate publications:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Equivariant heat and Schr&ouml;dinger flows from Euclidean
            space to complex projective space
            (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08188">Arxiv</a>).
        </li>
        <li>
            Resonant Hamiltonian systems associated to the one-dimensional
            non-linear Schr&ouml;dinger equation with harmonic trapping
            (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08190">Arxiv</a>).
