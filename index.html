    <h1>James Fennell</h1>

    <p>
        Hello!
        I just finished a PhD in mathematics at NYU,
        and in July will begin working as a software engineer
        at <a href="https://schrodinger.com">Schr&ouml;dinger</a> in New York.
    </p>

    <p>
        My software projects are hosted on my 
        <a href="https://github.com/jamespfennell">Github page</a>.
        I can be reached at jamespfennell@gmail.com.

                <a href="https://github.com/jamespfennell/mathtime-installer">
                Installer for the MathTime Professional 2 fonts</a> 
                on Tex Live in Linux or macOS. 
                I highly recommend you move away from using the monotonous
                Computer Modern Latex fonts and use MathTime instead. It's free!

                The 
                <a href="http://ctan.org/pkg/studenthandouts">Student 
                Handouts Latex package</a>
                provides an easy to use mechanism for managing the production of 
                handouts to be used in class. It also provides some changeable 
                handout styling,
                and comes with pretty extensive documentation.
                (See also the

                Taking the New York City Subway?
                Use the <a href="https://www.realtimerail.nyc">realtimerail.nyc</a>
                web app to see when your train will arrive!
                My long term plan is to clean up the code base and open source it.

                The <a href="https://github.com/jamespfennell/realtime-aggregator">
                Realtime Aggregator software</a>
                was designed to collect generic realtime data feeds.
                It's currently 
                deployed collecting NYC Subway data for potential future
                data research.

        <h2>Mathematics</h2>

        <p>
            I have a PhD in mathematics from the Courant Institute at NYU.
            My advisor was <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/~pgermain">
            Pierre Germain</a>.
            My thesis is entitled
            <a href="./JamesFennell-PhDThesis.pdf">
            Two topics in the theory of nonlinear Schr&ouml;dinger equations</a>.
